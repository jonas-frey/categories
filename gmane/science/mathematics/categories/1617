Dear Category Theorist:

This is the final announcement for the Special Session on "Applied
Categorical Structures" at the up-coming AMS Meeting in Toronto, Sept. 23&24.
The Session will be held in Room 2173 of the Medical Sciences Building on the
downtown campus  of the University of Toronto. It will start on Saturday at 9am
and finish on Sunday at 5pm.

For comprehensive and continually updated meeting and program information,
including accommodation in Toronto, see

http://www.ams.org/meetings/

For the the program of the Session, see also the end of this message. There has
been one change since Andre' Joyal is not able to attend, due to sudden
unavoidable circumstances.

There will be a WELCOME PARTY on Friday, September 22, starting at 7pm, for
participants of the Session. With funds provided by York University we are
pleased to be able to invite you and your spouse/friend to a complimentary
buffet dinner (open till 10pm) in the Thai restaurant

"Sawaddee" at 150 Avenue Road, Toronto, tel. (416) 921 9198.

The restaurant is located at the north-west corner of the intersection of
Avenue Road with Davenport, which is 7 (very short) blocks north of Bloor St.
It's about a 15-minute walk from the UofT-campus, and less than 5 minutes from
the Howard Johnson Inn which we mentioned in our previous message. The walk
from the Days Inn on Carlton St would be about 30 minutes; a reasonable
alternative to walking all the way or taking a short taxi ride would be walking
westbound from the hotel on Carlton and College to Bay Street and taking the
"Bay" bus no.6 north and to get off right at the intersection Avenue
Rd/Davenport (subway token or exact fare $2 required). If coming by car to the
restaurant, your best bet would be to search for spots on the streets in the
area north west of the restaurant, success not guaranteed.

In order for us to know the approximate number of participants, PLEASE LET US
KNOW BY FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, WHETHER YOU'LL BE COMING TO THE WELCOME PARTY, by
e-mailing tholen@mathstat.yorku.ca (see form below).

We look forward to seeing you in Toronto.

Joan Wick Pelletier
Walter Tholen

> Abstract:
>
> We show that any category with a functoral multiplication has
> asociated to it a handful of groups that are strongly related to
> infinte, finitely presented groups discovered by Richard Thompson.
> To add weight to the connection between the multiplication and the
> groups, we prove that if associativity and commutativity
> equivalences are given, then they are are coherent (in the sense of
> MacLane) if and only if two of the groups turn out to be isomorphic
> to two of the groups discovered by Thompson.  This is the beginning
> (low dimensional part) of the formalization of the already known
> relation between coherence questions and Thompson's groups.
