Thanks, Peter, for compiling this list, this is great!

There were also "Kategorien" meetings at Oberwolfach in 1972 and 1973,
organized by John Gray and Horst Schubert, which were probably
instrumental in establishing the tradition of summer conferences in
category theory:

Oberwolfach, 23-29 July, 1972,
Oberwolfach, 22-28 July, 1973.

When leafing through the Oberwolfach archives (to recall the dates
above), to my surprise, I saw that there was also a summer conference
on "Kategorien und Funktoren" in 1966, organized by Albrecht Dold and
Saunders Mac Lane(!):

Oberwolfach, 17-23 July, 1966.

This was just one year after the 1965 La Jolla meeting, probably to be
considered the first major international conference on category theory
ever. In Aveiro (CT2015) we acknowledged the 50th anniversary of that
pivotal conference.

With the help of all readers of the list (and perhaps by leafing
through old Springer Lecture Notes), it should be possible to close the
information gap in the open interval (1966,1972).
