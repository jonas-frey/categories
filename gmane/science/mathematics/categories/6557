Of course the initial responses  given by Fred and me were notthemselves al=
gorithmic=2C but why can they not be a prelude to such?Fred recalled the se=
quence of UMPs that defines Omega and I recalled what results in the case o=
f a finite site. The hope is that experts in Maple and the like will be abl=
e to solve the sort of problem needed to generate displays. That is=2C give=
n a finite presentation of a category C=2Cfind a presentation of the result=
ing Heyting algebra with the action ofC on it. Of course as stated this inc=
ludes the Burnside problem =2C the Post problem etc . Hence the need for re=
cognizing solvable subproblems.Even  for the class of graphic monoids=2C wh=
ere the structure is finite=2C it growsexponentially =2C which has been use=
d in the past by other computer scientists as an excuse not to consider it.=
  But if we are given a few fixed finite C=2C we can consider the class of c=
ategories discretely fiberedover them (equivalent to objects of the toposes=
) and try to see whetherOmega is computable in the above sense for them.
I  said contravariant 2-valued functors and of course these factor through =
the poset reflection. Calculating that poset reflection is a search problem=
  wrt=20
the underlying graph=2C but actually wrt composition as well since we have =
