Call  ES_CITADEL_2016_postdoc
======================================================================
Opening date:  September 1, 2016
Closing date:  October 1, 2016

A Researcher position is available in the Embedded Systems Research
Unit (ES) at Bruno Kessler Foundation (FBK), Center for Information
Technology.

FBK is a private research institution based in Trento (Italy) and
operating in different scientific fields and disciplines. As such, it
has the role of keeping the Autonomous Province of Trento within the
mainstream of international research. FBK is made up of seven research
centre, whose activities and production are available at
http://www.fbk.eu/research-centers.

The Embedded Systems Research Unit (ES Unit) of the Information and
Communication Technology Center of the Bruno Kessler Foundation
(FBK-irst), Trento, Italy consists of about 25 people, including
researchers, post-docs, PhD students, and programmers. The Unit
carries out research, tool development and technology transfer in the
field of design and verification of embedded systems.

Current research directions include:
* Satisfiability Modulo Theory, and its application to the
verification of hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid
systems (Verilog, SystemC, C/C++, StateFlow/Simulink);
* Model Based Planning and Scheduling of aerospace domains using model
checking and satisfiability modulo theory techniques;
* Formal Requirements Analysis based on techniques for temporal logics
(consistency checking, vacuity detection, input determinism,
cause-effect analysis, realizability and synthesis);
* Model-based engineering and formal verification of aerospace systems
using model checking techniques, on-board reasoning systems for
autonomous vehicles using planning techniques;
* Formal Safety Analysis, based on the integration of traditional
techniques (e.g. Fault-tree analysis, FMEA) with symbolic verification
techniques.

More information about the ES Unit is available at http://es.fbk.eu/ .

Job Description
======================================================================

The ES Unit has an opening for a PostDoc position in the framework of
CITADEL ("Critical Infrastructure Protection using Adaptive MILS"), an
H2020 European project started on June 1, 2016. The successful
candidate will be employed for a period of at least two years (with a
trial period of 6 months). He/She will carry out research activities
in the field of formal methods applied to the design and
implementation of adaptive systems with critical safety and security
requirements. In particular, the activities will focus on:
* declarative languages to specify dynamic architectures, their
monitoring and reconfiguration
* contract-based framework for compositional verification of the
system based on the properties of components
* design and synthesis of monitors to ensure that local properties are
satisfied
* design and synthesis of the architecture reconfiguration
* generation of proofs
The candidate is expected to work in collaboration with other
researchers, programmers, and students involved in the project.

Required:

* PhD in computer science, mathematics or electronic engineering (to
be completed within 2016)
* Solid background in logic
* Software development skills (preferably in C and Python)
* Ability to carry out an independent research program
* Ability to work in a collaborative environment and deliver in research projects
* Oral and written proficiency in English

Preferred:

In depth previous experience in at least one of the following areas:
* Symbolic Model Checking
* Temporal Logics and Property Specification Languages
* Satisfiability Modulo Theory
* Formal Specification and Analysis of Architectures
* Contracts and Interface Theories
* Architecture Description Languages
* Software Model Checking
* Model-Based Safety Analysis (e.g., automatic generation of fault trees)
