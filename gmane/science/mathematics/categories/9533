Dear Steve,

This is response to your message reproduced below.=20

I am aware of Johnstone=E2=80=99s results on the lower bagdomain. However, =
both the symmetric monad M and the lower bagdomain monad B_L on BTop_S are =
=E2=80=9Con the same side=E2=80=9D as the lower power locale monad P_L on L=
oc_S, and the latter is the localic reflection for both. The upper power lo=
cale monad P_U on Loc_S is =E2=80=9Con the other side=E2=80=9D, in a sense =
that is explained in my =E2=80=98Pitts monads paper=E2=80=9D.In it I deduce=
  effective lax descent theorems in a general setting of what I call "Pitts =
KZ-monads" and "Pitts co-KZ-monads" on a =E2=80=9C2-category of spaces=E2=
=80=9D.=20

In the case of M on BTop_S, it is the S-essential surjective geometric morp=
hisms that are shown to be of lax effective descent (a result originally du=
e to Andy Pitts). In the case of P_L on Loc-S it is the open surjections of=
  locales that are shown to be of lax effective descent (a result originally=
  due to Joyal-Tierney). Both M and P_L are instances of "Pitts KZ-monads". =
Now,  P_U on Loc_S is instead an instance of a" Pitts co-KZ-monad" and the =
result recovered from my general setting is that proper surjections of loca=
les are of effective lax descent (a result originally due to Jaapie Vermeul=
en). What I seek is a co-KZ-monad N (or perhaps B_U) on BTop_S for which my=
  general theorem would give me that relatively tidy surjections of toposes =
are of effective lax descent (a result due to I. Moerdijk and J.C.C.Vermeul=
en).=20

In my Pitts paper there is another consequence of the general theorem prove=
d therein and it is that coherent surjections between coherent toposes are =
of effective lax descent (a result proven by different methods and by sever=
al people,  such asM. Zawadowsky 1995, D.Ballard and W.Boshuck 1998, and I.=
Moerdijk and J.C.C.Vermeulen 1994,thus establishing a conjecture of Pitts 1=
985 (in the Cambridge Conference whose slides you have requested to Andy). =
It is of interest for what we are discussing to point out that the =E2=80=
=9Ccoherent monad C=E2=80=9D that I use therein to deduce the latter from m=
y general theorem is a Pitts co-KZ-monad, hence on the =E2=80=9Csame side=
=E2=80=9D as P_U for Loc_S.  For a coherent topos E, the coherent monad C(E=
) applied to it classifies pretopos morphisms E_{coh} =E2=80=94> S. where E=
_{coh} is the full subcategory of E of coherent objects with the topology o=
f finite coverings. This theorem is perhaps all I can get in my setting whe=
n searching for the still elusive N or B_U but I have not given up yet.=20

Also in my 2015 Pitts paper there are characterizations of the algebras for=
  a Pitts KZ-monad M (dually for a Pitts co-KZ-monad N) as the "stably M-com=
plete objects" ("stably N-complete objects"), where the former is stated in=
  terms of pointwise left Kan extensions along M-maps, and the latter in ter=
ms of pointwise right Kan extensions along N-maps. These notions owe much t=
o the work of M, Escardo, in particular to his 1998 "Properly injective spa=
ces and function spaces=E2=80=9D.=20

I will say more when i know more myself. Thanks very much for your pointers=
. I will most certainly look into them even if I do not at the moment think=
  they are what I need.=20


Best regards,
Marta

Dear Marta,

Johnstone showed that B_L(X) is a partial product of X against the "generic=
  local homeomorphism", a geometric morphism p from the classifier of pointe=
d objects to the object classifier. A point of B_L(X) is a family of points=
  of X, indexed by elements of a set.

He also proposed other partial products, for example those against the gene=
ric entire map, which goes to the classifier for Boolean algebras from the =
classifier of Boolean algebras equipped with prime filter. Wouldn't that be=
  your B_U? A point would be a family of points of X, indexed by points of a=
  Stone space.

Steve.
