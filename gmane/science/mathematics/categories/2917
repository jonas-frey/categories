There has been a long discussion on the list=20
about "categories without identities", whatever=20
you decide to call them. And the attention has=20
been brought to axioms which could -- in this=20
more general context -- replace the identity=20
axiom.

I would like to focus on a very striking categorical aspect of this problem.

A (right) module M on a ring R with unit must satisfy the axiom m1=3Dm
=2E.. but what about the case when R does not have a unit ?

Simply dropping the axiom m1=3Dm leaves you with=20
the unpleasant situation where you have two=20
different notions of module, in the case where R=20
has a unit.

Therefore people working in linear algebra have considered the axiom

      the scalar multiplication M@R ---> M is an isomorphism
      (@=3Dtensor product sign)

which is equivalent to the axiom m1=3Dm, when the=20
ring has a unit ... but makes perfect sense when=20
the ring does not have a unit. Such modules are=20
generally called "Taylor regular".

A ring R with unit is simply a one-objet additive=20
category and a right module M on R is simply an=20
additive presheaf M ---> Ab (=3Dthe category of=20
abelian groups).

A ring without unit is thus a "one-object=20
additive category without identity", again=20
whatever you decide to call this.

But what is the analogue of the axiom

      M@R ---> M is an isomorphism

when R is now an arbitrary small (enriched)=20
"category without identities" and M is an=20
arbitrary (enriched) presheaf on it ?

All of us know that to define a (co)limit, we do=20
not need at all to start with an indexing=20
category: an arbitrary graph with arbitrary=20
commutativity conditions works perfectly well. In=20
particular, a "category without identities" is=20
all right. And the same holds in the enriched=20
case, with (co)limits replaced by "weighted=20
(co)limits".

Now every presheaf on a small category is=20
canonically a colimit of representable ones ...=20
but this result depends heavily on the existence=20
of identities ! When you work with a presheaf M=20
on a "category R without identities", you still=20
have a canonical morphism

      canonical colimit of representables ---> R

and you can call M "Taylor regular" when this is=20
an isomorphism. Again in the enriched case,=20
"colimit" means "weighted colimit". This=20
recaptures exactly the case of "Taylor regular=20
modules", when working with Ab-enriched=20
categories.

A sensible axiom to put on a "category R without=20
identities" is the fact that the representable=20
functors are "Taylor regular". (We should=20
certainly call this something else than "Taylor=20
regular", but let me keep this terminology in=20
this message.)

And when R is a "Taylor regular category without identities", the constructi=
on

      presheaf on R |---> corresponding canonical colimit of representables

yields a reflection for the inclusion of Taylor=20
regular presheaves in all presheaves.

A very striking property is the existence of a=20
further (necessarily full and faithful) left=20
adjoint to this reflection. This second inclusion=20
provides in fact an equivalence with the full=20
subcategory of those presheaves which satisfy the=20
Yoneda isomorphism.

This yields thus a nice example of what Bill=20
Lawvere calls the "unity of opposites": the two=20
inclusions identify the category of Taylor=20
regular presheaves with
* on one side, those presheaves which are colimits of representables;
* on the other side, those presheaves which satisfy the Yoneda lemma.
This underlines the pertinence of these "Taylor=20
regular categories without identities".

To my knowledge, the best treatment of these=20
questions is to be found in various papers by=20
Marie-Anne Moens and by Isar Stubbe, in=20
particular in the "Cahiers" and in "TAC".

And very interesting examples occur in functional=20
analysis (the identity on a Hilbert space is a=20
compact operator ... if and only if the space is=20
finite dimensional) and also in the theory of=20
quantales.
