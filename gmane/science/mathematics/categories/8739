Stephen: MY NEXT GUEST IS THE SENIOR LECTURER OF PURE MATHEMATICS AT
           THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD. PLEASE WELCOME DR. EUGENIA CHENG!
           DOCTOR, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. [spplsudr DOCTOR, YOU'VE
           GOT A NEW BOOK. "HOW TO BAKE PI." AN EDIBLE EXPLORATION OF THE
           MATHEMATICS OF MATHEMATICS. FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS PURE
           MATHEMATICS, WHAT YOU TEACH.
Eugenia: PURE MATH MATHEMATICS IS THE BEST IND OF MATHEMATICS. IT'S THE
           MOST DELICIOUS.
Stephen: THAT DOES NOT QUALIFY AS AN ARGUMENT. HOW DO YOU TEACH THE
           MATHEMATICS OF MATHEMATICS. AND I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO
           TECHNICAL HERE, WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?
Eugenia: IT MEANS TAKING VERY SIMPLE INGREDIENTS LIKE WE HAVE HERE,
           BUTTER AND FLOUR, DOING COMPLICATED THINGS WITH THEM AND MAKING
           SOMETHING DELICIOUS.
Stephen: OKAY, I'M SLIGHTLY SCARED OF YOU RIGHT NOW. OKAY. THANKS VERY
           MUCH. THIS IS-- [picks up rolling pin] THIS IS HOW DANIEL CRAIG
           [earlier guest]  GOT STITCHES. [laughter] OKAY, SO, TEACH ME
           SOMETHING ABOUT MATH WITH COOKING.
Eugenia: LOOK AT THIS.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT?
Eugenia: THAT IS MILLE-FEUILLE. SEE THE MATH IN THAT? ISN'T IT
DELICIOUS.
Stephen: IT LOOKS GOOD.
Eugenia: IT MEANS 1,000 LAYERS. DO YOU SEE 1,000 LAYERS.
Stephen: I SEE THREE LAYERS.
Eugenia: YOU'RE NOT LOOKING CLOSELY ENOUGH. LOOK MORE CLOSELY. LOOK AT
           ALL THE DELICIOUS LAYERS INSIDE THE PUFF PASTRY.
Stephen: YES, MA'AM.
Eugenia: COULD THERE REALLY BE COULD THERE REALLY BE A 1000 LAYERS?
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW.
Eugenia: IT'S THE POWER OF MATH.
Stephen: SHOW ME HOW.
Eugenia: WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME PUFF PASTRY.
Stephen: OKAY, GREAT.
Eugenia: THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS BASH THE BUTTER.
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO BASH THE BUTTER? HOW MUCH BUTTER -- HOW MUCH
           -- HOW MUCH BUTTER GOES INTO THAT?
Eugenia: NOT VERY MUCH. VERY HEALTHY
Stephen: HOW MUCH -- HOW MUCH HOW MUCH IS THIS?
Eugenia: ABOUT HALF A POUND. WE'RE BASHING IT TO MAKE IT THE RIGHT
           CONSISTENCY TO GO IN THE PASTRY. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN MATH
           TO HAVE THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY.
Stephen: MY NEXT GUEST IS THE SENIOR LECTURER OF PURE MATHEMATICS AT
           THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD. PLEASE WELCOME DR. EUGENIA CHENG!
           DOCTOR, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ( APPLAUSE ) DOCTOR, YOU

           CONSISTENCY TO GO IN THE PASTRY. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN MATH
           TO HAVE THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY. THEY DON'T TELL YOU THAT IN
           SCHOOL.
Stephen: NO, THEY DON'T. I'M GLAD YOU TEACH MATH AND NOT HEALTH.
Eugenia: I'M VERY HEALTHY. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.
Stephen: THERE'S STILL SOME WAX IN THAT.
Eugenia: DELICIOUS. VERY HEALTHY WAX. WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE BUTTER ON
           THIS LOVELY PASTRY.
Eugenia: AND WE'RE GOING TO WRAP IT UP
Stephen: WHILE COUNTING OUR CHOLESTEROL.
Eugenia: EXACTLY. EXACTLY
Stephen: DO I BASH IT AGAIN.
Eugenia: IF YOU LIKE. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE.
Stephen: TELL ME THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
Eugenia: IT'S ANYTHING YOU LIKE. MATH IS ABOUT MAKE YOUR OWN RULES UP.
Stephen: BUT BAKING IS NOT. [laughter, applause] YOU MIGHT BE A GREAT
           MATHEMATICIAN BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD BAKING.
Eugenia: WE'RE GOING TO ROLL IT OUT.
Stephen: YOU ROLL IT OUT,
Eugenia: OKAY. AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO LAYERS, TWO LAYERS OF PASTRY.
           NOW WE'RE GOING TO FOLD IT UP.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
Eugenia: I'M GOING TO FOLD IT INTO THREE. THREE.
Stephen: NOW WE HAVE SIX LAYERS.
Eugenia: WELL DONE!
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR.
Eugenia: THANK YOU SO MUCH-- WE'RE GOING TO ROLL IT OUT AGAIN.
Stephen: OKAY,
Eugenia: ALL RIGHT. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO FOLD IT IN THREE AGAIN.
Stephen: OKAY.
Eugenia: AND THEN IT'S GOING TO HAVE THREE TIMES SIX WHICH IS.
Stephen: THREE TIMES SIX IS 18.
Eugenia: AMAZING! YOU SEE? AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN. AND
           IN FACT, THOUGH, HERE WHAT WE HAVE-- GO ON.
Eugenia: HERE'S ONE I MADE EARLIER.
Stephen: SO HERE WE'RE GOING TO-- WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.
Eugenia: WE'RE GOING TO DO IT SIX TIMES. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO TIMES
           THREE, THREE, THREE, THREE, THREE, THREE AND THEN WE'RE GOING
           TO PUT THREE LAYERS INTO THAT.
Stephen: OKAY.
Eugenia: SO THAT'S ANOTHER THREE.
Stephen: SO IT'S THERE TO THE SEVENTH TIMES TWO.
Eugenia: YOU CAN DO THAT
Stephen: 4,372?
Eugenia: SEE, I CAN'T DO THIS BECAUSE I'M A MATHEMATICIAN, NOT A
           CALCULATOR. [laughter, applause]
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY LAYERS DO WE HAVE?
Eugenia: 4 THOUSAND -- I LOOKED IT UP EARLIER ON MY PHONE.
Stephen: SO DID I.
Eugenia: BECAUSE MATH IS NOT ACTUALLY JUST ABOUT NUMBER S.
Stephen: NO?
Eugenia: THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS IS WE USED SOME REALLY TIDY NUMBERS TWO,
           THREE, VERY SMALL NUMBERS.
Stephen: THERE'S A SMALLER ONE.
Eugenia: YEAH, OKAY. AND IT QUICKLY BECAME A HUGE NUMBER! WE MADE
           SOMETHING DELICIOUS BY THE POWER OF EXPONENTIALS.
Stephen: THE BOOK IS "HOW TO BAKE PI." DR. EUGENIA CHENG, EVERYBODY.
Eugenia: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
