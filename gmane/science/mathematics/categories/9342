Dear Category Theorists,=20

In view of the discussion of the Thurston article, you may be interested  i=
n a much lower key article about mathematics and its methodology, addressed=
  also to beginners, and to educators. I have met one professor of maths who=
  claimed "mathematics has no need of methodology", which is odd since most =
human activities seem to benefit from such a discussion. which can be at va=
rious levels depending on the audience.=20

http://www.groupoids.org.uk/methmat.html

I met Fred a few times at some category theory meetings, and always found h=
im easy to get on with and with a firm idea on what the subject was about! =
And a nice sense of humour!


Best wishes

Ronnie

Dear Eduardo,

Thank you for recalling this remarkable article by Thurston.
It contains profound observations on the role of *communities* in the creat=
ion of mathematics.
Mathematical research is about developing *human understanding* of mathemat=
ics.

Thurston does not mention category theory.
I remember trying to learn algebraic topology by reading the=20
"Foundations of Algebraic Topology" by Eilenberg and Steenrod.=20
It is a great book, but not the right place to learn the subject.
I also tried to learn algebraic geometry by reading the=20
"Elements de Geometrie Algebrique" by Grothendieck and Dieudonn=C3=A9.
I never became an algebraic-geometer.
It is very difficult to learn anything without direct access to the people =
who knows.

Best,
Andr=C3=A9

Subject: categories: "op"_Fred_and_Thurston

1) Two days ago by chance I come across an article of Bill Thurston:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236.pdf

and seeing his name mentioned in this thread it occurs to me that
everybody in this list should read it. In my opinion it is an
extraordinary document about mathematics, mathematical activity and
mathematicians.

2) Respect to to subject of this thread, the formal opposite of a
category, denoted "op", is simply a notation very useful to work with
functors which are contravariant in some variables, either with the "op"
in the domain or the codomain of the functor arrow.

Notations are important, and the "op" notation is essential in the
language of categories and functors.

3) Finally, concerning Fred Linton, his death sadness me, he did
important work in the early days of category theory, but more important,
he was one of us, it was always a pleasure to encounter him, an he was a
good guy.

all the best   e.d.
