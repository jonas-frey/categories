Hi Categorists,

I recently moved to University of Hawaii at Manoa, and we have several =
openings for categorically minded postdocs, PhD students, and possibly =
for visiting researchers. The positions are within the NSF and AFOSR =
funded projects, which are broadly based on the past work in:

** categorically based data analysis and concept mining:
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5802
http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6428
http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1306

** graphic languages for computability, complexity and cryptography
http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5205
http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5687
http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6488

** categorical view of security protocols and procedures
http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6324
http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0706 (challenge: spot bifibrations lurking in =
the background)

please let me know if you might be interested to work in any of these =
areas.

The positions are at the Deparment of Information and Computer Sciences =
of University of Hawaii at Manoa, which is the largest node of the UH =
network, with a beautiful campus in the hills above Waikiki, minutes =
from downtown Honolulu.

all the best,
-- dusko
