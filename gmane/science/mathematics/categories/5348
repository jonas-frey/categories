There are several comments I could make to this posting, but I will
confine myself to two.  First, I was around all through the 70s (and most
of the 60s) and I have no idea what categorists did to earn the opprobrium
described below.  A colleague of mine commented one day maybe 25 years
ago, that it seemed in the 60s that category theory would be important,
but it hasn't turned out that way.  I am not sure what didn't turn out
that way, but that seemed to have been the general opinion.

Second, a couple of papers by Linton and Manes in the Zurich Triples Book
(LNM #80) makes very explicit the connection between triples and universal
algebraic theories.  Although doubtless out of print, a dozen of us put a
lot of effort into retyping it in tex and republishing it as a TAC
reprint.  If someone wants to go ahead and replace every instance of
"triple" by "monad" go ahead.  Also Beck's tripleableness theorem is in
Beck's thesis, another TAC reprint also retyped by volunteers.

Incidentally (although Paul is well aware of this) every paper of mine
later than 1985 and every earlier paper of which I had an electronic
trace, is available on my personal ftp site.  Also incidentally my wife
and I retyped Grothendieck's Tohoku paper and are waiting only for
proof-reading by the Van Osdols to post it (hint, hint, since I know Don
reads this group).
