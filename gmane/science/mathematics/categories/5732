I would like to make a few observations.
If my recollection is right,  during the 1980's the dream of some topos =
theorists=20
(including myself) was to use atomic toposes as generalised =
K(pi,1)-spaces.
The dream has not materialised and it maybe foolish.

Another avenue is to extend Grothendieck Galois theory, since the
fundamental groupoid of a space classifies the covers of that space.
Eduardo Dubuc is presently developing a general theory of Galois =
toposes.
The fundamental Galois topos of a topos E could be defined as the=20
reflection E--->E(1) of E into the full subcategory of Galois toposes
over the base topos S. I am not supposing that S is the category of =
sets.
I am writing E(1) because I want to suggest that it is a stage of
a Postnikov tower of S-toposes:=20

E(-1)<---E(0)<---E(1)<----E(2)<----

The topos E(-1) is of course the image of the=20
geometric morphisme E-->S. The construction of E(-1)=20
depends on the factorisation system=20

(epimorphisms of toposes, sub-toposes)

The topos E(0) is the totally disconnected localic reflection of E
over the base topos S. Its construction
depends on the factorisation system=20

(connected morphisms of toposes, totally disconnected localic morphisms)

The topos E(1) is the Galois topos reflection of E=20
over the base topos S. Its construction
depends on the factorisation system=20

(1-connected morphisms of toposes, Galois morphisms)


The topos E(2) does not exists in general for the
simple reason that it is a 2-topos, not an ordinary
topos. A 2-topos is enriched over groupoids.
=20
The whole theory depends on three factorisation systems=20

(epimorphisms of toposes, sub-toposes)
(connected morphisms of toposes, totally disconnected localic morphisms)
(1-connected morphisms of toposes, Galois morphisms)

The first factorisation system is well known and=20
was constructed a long time ago.

Excuse my ignorance, but I do not know if the=20
second factorisation system has been fully constructed.=20
Can someone tell me?

The third factorisation system was partially
constructed by Dubuc: he can factor
the morphism E-->S when S is the category of sets.

My observations concerning your problems
could be off the mark.


Best,
Andr=E9
