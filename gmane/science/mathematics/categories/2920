As I know nothing about Computer Algebra Systems, but was surprised by=20=

examples given by Andrej Bauer on the Category list of limits that=20
Mathematica gets wrong, I forwarded his mail to a computer scientist=20
friend of mine, specialist of Mathematca, asking for her opinion.

She wrote the following answer, where she disagrees with Bauer, and=20
asked me to forward it to the Category list as she would like to know=20
the reaction of some "experts" to her statements. To tell the truth, so=20=

do I.

Cordially to all,

Jean Benabou
