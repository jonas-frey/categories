Depends what you mean by topological. In the category of locales, regular
epis aren't closed under composition (equivalently, regular monos aren't
closed under composition in frames): this was proved by Till Plewe, and
is in his paper `Quotient maps of locales' in Appl. Cat. Struct. 8 (2000),
17--44. Another `natural' example (which I regularly use when teaching
category theory to graduate students) is regular epis in Cat.
