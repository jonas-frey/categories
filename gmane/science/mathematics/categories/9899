Third call for submissions
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HOMOTOPY TYPE THEORY

12-17 August 2019
Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh USA

https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2019
**************************************************************

Submission of talks and registration are open for the International
Homotopy Type Theory conference (HoTT 2019), to be held August 12-17,
2019, at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, USA.  Contributions
are welcome in all areas related to homotopy type theory, including
but not limited to:

* Homotopical and higher-categorical semantics of type theory
* Synthetic homotopy theory
* Applications of univalence and higher inductive types
* Cubical type theories and cubical models
* Formalization of mathematics and computer science in homotopy type
theory / univalent foundations

Please submit 1-paragraph abstracts through EasyChair here:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hott2019

The submission deadline has been EXTENDED to 15 MAY 2019; we expect to
notify accepted submissions by 1 June.  This conference is run on the
"mathematics model": full papers will not be submitted, submissions
will not be refereed, and submission is not a publication.  Please
email hott2019conference@gmail.com with any questions.


STUDENT PAPER AWARD

A prize of $500 (and distinguished billing in the conference program)
will be awarded to the best paper submitted by a student (or recently
graduated student). To be eligible, you must include in your
submission (or send separately to hott2019conference@gmail.com) a link
to a preprint of your paper (e.g. on arXiv or a private web space).


REGISTRATION, ACCOMODATION, AND TRAVEL

Registration for the conference and the summer school is now open at
https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2019/registration/.  A limited amount of
financial support is available for students and postdoctoral
researchers; application instructions are available at the web site,
as is information about accomodation and travel options.
