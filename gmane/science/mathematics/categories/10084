As part of the

35th Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications
https://ysu.edu/sumtopo

to be held July 13-17, 2020, at Youngstown State University, Ohio,
we are organizing a special session on

Enriched Categories and Topology.

The goal of the session is to provide a forum for recent research in a
field pursued by topologists, analysts and algebraists alike. Many of
them see Lawvere's milestone paper on Metric spaces, generalized logic,
and closed categories at the origin of this emerging field. Especially
quantalic settings have received much attention during the past two
decades, but the session is by no means limited to these.

We invite anybody interested in attending and/or contributing to the
session to contact us, preferably before February 29, 2020.
