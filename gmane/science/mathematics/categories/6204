Right.  I would prefer to use no identity types at all.
If there is a particular predicate (on some particular type)
that you would like to think of as equality (on that type),
then write down its definition and introduce a symbol for it.
But I would not write any particular predicate into the language,
even with intensional behaviour, if I don't need it.

However, it is interesting that intentional identity types/predicates
satisfy weaker axioms than the extensional equality of first-order logic,
enough so that we are still driven away from using strict concepts.

>identity types are not necessary for doing constructive mathematics.

Nor for nonconstructive mathematics; excluded middle is a red herring.
Type theory naturally lends itself to constructive interpretation,
but one can add rules for excluded middle, even the axiom of choice,
if one wants to do classical mathematics.

However, questions of predicativity ARE important.
(Some type theories become impredicative when excluded middle is added,
  as Martin-Loef's do, but not all do; impredicativity is what matters.)
In sufficiently impredicative mathematics, identity can be defined:
  Given a type A and elements x and y of A, x is _identical_ to y
  if, for every predicate p on A, p holds for x iff p holds for y.
(This definition is usually attributed to Gottfried Leibniz.)
So you get an identity predicate by quantifying over all predicates,
in a theory that allows this.

It would be interesting to hear from people who want to keep kosher,
but also want to reason impredicatively, how to interpret this definition.
(For my part, I want to be both kosher *and* predicative by default,
  only abandoning predicativity when this seems to be needed.
  Very little basic category theory relies on impredicative reasoning.)

Quite right; I really should not have mentioned that at all.
So everyone, delete this line from your memory of my previous post:
>>Heck, there's even a notion of identity of types!

Identity judgements are less problematic than identity types.
And some form of identity judgement seems to be necessary
to fully develop foundational-strength dependent type theory.
Actually, I don't so much seem to need identity judgements
as beta-convertibility (although you can define beta-equivalence
in terms of beta-convertibility, and call that identity).
I started to write this up once, but I never finished it.

The point is that one can recognise that two syntactic expressions,
such as x and x, are the same, or even that one reduces to another,
such as fst(x,y) and x (where fst: A x B -> A is the usual projection),
but this is different from taking two completely different expressions,
such as x and y, and considering the hypothesis that they are the same.
