Dear Michael

Thank you for your message.

My message was perhaps a bit cryptic.
By statement of the PBW theorem I mean that,
essentially, relative to the PBW filtration of the
universal algebra UL of the Lie algebra L, the
canonical algebra morphism from the symmetric algebra SL
to the associated graded object E^0(UL) is an isomorphism.
This then implies that the canonical map
from L to UL is injective.

More precisely: The universal algebra UL and the symmetric algebra SL both
acquire filtered cocommutative coalgebra structures,
and the canonical morphism
SL --> E^0(UL)
is one of Hopf algebras. One way to make precise the statement of the PBW
theorem is to require the existence of an isomorphism
UL --> SL of filtered coalgebras such that the
associated graded morphism
E^0(UL) --> SL
is the inverse to the canonical morphism
SL --> E^0(UL).

Certainly the freeness of the Lie algebra is enough to guarantee
the statement of the PBW theorem.
More generally, L projective as a module over the ground ring
still suffices I guess.
Indeed, the arguments you give in Subsection 5.3 of your 1996 JPAA algebra
paper imply this.

Best regards

Johannes
