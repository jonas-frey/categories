===============================================================================


Introduction
------------
The ICLP Doctoral Consortium (DC) is the sixth doctoral consortium to be
offered as part of the 26th International Conference on Logic Programming. The
DC follows the very positive experience of the previous events held held in
Sitges (Spain) on October 3rd, 2005, in Seattle (WA) on August 21st, 2006,
in Porto (Portugal) on September 8th, 2007, in Udine (Italy) on December 10th,
2008, and in Pasadena (USA) on July 15th, 2009.

The DC will take place at the end of ICLP 2010 in Edinburgh (Scotland, U.K).
The Doctoral Consortium is designed for doctoral students working in areas
related to logic and constraint programming, with a particular emphasis to
students interested in pursuing a career in academia. The Consortium is also
open to exceptional Master's students developing MS Theses in Logic
Programming. The Doctoral Consortium aims to provide students with an
opportunity to present and discuss their research directions and to obtain
feedback from peers as well as world-renown experts in the field.


General Information
-------------------
This year the Doctoral Consortium  will be held at the end if the
regular activities of the ICLP 2010 Conference. The aims of the Doctoral
Consortium are:
  * To provide  doctoral students  working in the  field of  logic and
    constraint programming  with a friendly and open  forum to present
    their research  ideas, listen to ongoing work  from peer students,
    and receive constructive feedback.
  * To  provide  students with  relevant  information about important
    issues for doctoral candidates and future academics.
  * To  develop a  supportive community  of scholars  and a  spirit of
    collaborative research.
  * To support  a new generation  of researchers with  information and
    advice  on  academic,  research, industrial,  and  non-traditional
    career paths.

The Consortium is designed for  students currently enrolled in a Ph.D.
program,  though  we  are  also  open to  exceptions  (e.g.,  students
currently in  a Masters program  and interested in  doctoral studies).
Students  at any stage in their doctoral studies are  encouraged  to
apply.  Applicants  are expected  to  be  conducting research in the field
of Logic Programming; topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
  * Theoretical Foundations of Logic and Constraint Logic Programming
  * Sequential and Parallel Implementation Technology
  * Static and Dynamic Analysis, Abstract Interpretation, Compilation
    Technology, Verification
  * Logic-based Paradigms (e.g., Answer Set Programming, Concurrent
    Logic Programming, Inductive Logic Programming)
  * Innovative Applications of Logic Programming

Submissions by students who have presented their work at a previous
ICLP Doctoral Consortiums are allowed, but should occur only if
there are substantial changes or improvements to the student's work.

The  Consortium  allows  participants  to  interact  with  established
researchers and with  other students, through presentations, question-
answer  sessions, panel  discussions, and  invited  presentations. The
Doctoral Consortium will provide  the possibility to reflect - through
short  activities,  information sessions,  and  discussions  - on  the
process and lessons of research and life in academia. Each participant
will give a short, critiqued, research presentation.

The Doctoral  Consortium will be held  on July 21, 2010; the ICLP
conference will  run from July 16th to  July 19th, 2010.
Doctoral Consortium  participants will  be offered the  opportunity to
have   their  abstracts   published  in   the  ICLP   2010  conference
proceedings. The best paper and presentation from the Doctoral Consortium
will be given the opportunity to present in special session of the main
ICLP conference.

Discussants:

Several renowned faculty members and researchers in the field of Logic
Programming will  join in evaluating  the submission packets  and will
participate  in the  Doctoral  Consortium, providing  feedback to  the
presenters.


Important Dates
---------------
Submission Deadline:                  April 11, 2010
Acceptance Notification:              April 21, 2010
Last Date to Update Research Summary: April 28, 2010 (tentative)
Doctoral Consortium:                  July 21, 2010
ICLP 2010 Conference:                 July 16-19, 2010


Submission Process
------------------

Application Process:
To apply for participation to the ICLP 2010 Doctoral Consortium, prepare a
submission package consisting of a cover letter, a research summary, and a
letter of recommendation (e.g., from your supervisor). The material should
be submitted electronically, in PDF format.

Review Criteria:
The ICLP Doctoral Consortium review committee will select participants based on
their anticipated contribution to the Consortium objectives. Participants
typically have settled on their thesis directions and had their research
proposal accepted by their thesis committee. Students will be selected based on
clarity and completeness of the submission packet, relevance of their research
area w.r.t. the focus of the ICLP Conference, stage of research, advisor's
letter, and evidence of promise towards a successful research and academic
career, such as published papers or technical reports.

Award:
The ICLP Doctoral Consortium Discussants will review the submissions to select
the ones to be presented. The organizing committee is actively seeking support
to offer scholarship packages to accepted participants. We will update the web
site as soon as we have more information regarding this.


Submission Package
------------------
Send the submission package by e-mail to iclp10dc@gmail.com.
Include the three documents as separate pdf files in attachment.
