Hi Michael and Paul,

These are indeed interesting observations and potential developments.

Let me try to connect this also to previous postings on automata and
"Turing categories". In that context, A and B are alphabets and states,
and maybe in rather abstract forms, but A and B are fundamentally
different. Whereas A is intuitively closer to terms so that TA can be a
construction by a term monad, B are statements and the "statement
functor" is usually not seen to be extendable to a monad (otherwise
there are only terms and no statements).

  From application point of of view, and indeed referring to possible
categorization of automata, T is more of a generalized powerfunctor, so
the term monad is hidden somewhere inside X, Y or Z. If so, and if that
term monad is made explicit, distributive laws will come into play.

Generalized powers may involve many-valuedness and as related to truth
value algebras. Such things invites to believing that applications
related to many-valuedness in ontology may become feasible. In some
previous postings I have tried to advertise that health care is a
typical area where this kind of algebraically explained many-valuedness
seems to come into play.

Funny, maybe, but the underpinnings may be quite serious, by the looks
of it. Maybe even dramatic e.g. for an extension of the notion of
evidence in evidence-based medicine.

Best,

Patrik
