Dear Peter

With questions like this, we naturally miss Max's expertise.
Allow me a few ramblings. While you did take a nice sample of
examples from different English speaking countries, they were
all from newspapers. In Australia, newspapers have long used
the American spellings; they used color, labor, . . . long before
other Australians. I found this strange as a kid. In fact, I believe
my old Collins Australian Dictionary would have given "r\^ole".
The Macquarie Dictionary gives "r\^ole" as a second usage as
American influences are growing.

The English word, as we know, comes from the French "r\^ole" for roll
of paper on which an actor's part was written. It was quite legitimate
for Webster to pin down American spelling before it had stabilized in =20=

England
and before the fashion in England favoured the French spellings
such as "programme". I suspect that "r\^ole" was part of that revision.
(Funnily, the French at the same time favoured English words and
names such as Edith.)

So I don't think it is in mathematics especially, except that we are =20
a bit
conservative when it comes to language. "Shew" was in my mathematics
text books as an undergraduate, and not in any other texts.

The typewriter, computer and mobile/cellular phone have also helped
eliminate accents (and, unfortunately, apostrophes).  Who wants
to look at <r\^ole>? Or <=FC> or <=E9> in the way my mailer transforms =
it to
yours? But I do want to preserve the distinctions:
	between <its> and <it's>,
	<building's>, <buildings>, and <buildings'> .

End of ramble.
