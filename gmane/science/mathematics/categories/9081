Dear Patrik,

There is a categorical account of Goedel's theorem, by Joyal, and dating bac=
k the 1980s (?). I first saw it presented by Gavin Wraith in 1985.

The Goedel gap between truth and provability is presented as an issue of int=
ernalizability. The logic adequate for expressing arithmetic is obviously no=
t ordinary finitary logic, which cannot characterize the natural numbers. In=
stead it is identified in categorical terms with "arithmetic universes". Cat=
egorically they have nnos and support free algebra constructions. But that i=
s enough to show that an arithmetic universe has, internally, its own initia=
l arithmetic universe. By nesting this construction, considering the initial=
  arithmetic universe in the initial arithmetic universe, one can make the co=
mparison between truth and provability and construct a Goedel sentence.

At least, that's my understanding of it. As far as I know the work is still u=
npublished, and in the outline I have seen there are steps that I believe bu=
t don't know how to prove, even though I am actively working on arithmetic u=
niverses. I'm not the fastest of mathematicians.

It's perhaps also worth noting that arithmetic universes support coherent lo=
gic, not full Boolean logic - no negation or implication.

Anyway, what I'm saying is that if you want to see category theory evaluate G=
oedel, then you should probably start with Joyal's work.

All the best,

Steve.
