Dear all,

as an obvious-in-hindsight followup in my part 2), the idea that
Epi(Y,X) =3D 0 gives strictness of a cardinal inequality clearly loses
its meaning in the absence of the Cantor-Bernstein-Schr=C3=B6der Theorem.
What should (perhaps) be considered is the subobject Iso(Y,X) of
Epi(Y,X), and if Y injects to X and Iso(Y,X) =3D 0, then one can
unambiguously say Y < X. Or at least less ambiguously! There are of
course variants where one says instead that (X surjects onto Y) xor
(Y=3D0), or Y is a subquotient of X.

One gets of course variants, for fixed X, analogous to the case X=3D|N
where different notions of finiteness arise (Kuratowski finite,
subfinite etc)

Best regards,

David
