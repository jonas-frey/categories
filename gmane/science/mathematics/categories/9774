Caleidoscope: Research School in Computational Complexity

Institut Henri Poincar??, Paris, 17-21 June 2019

http://caleidoscope.sciencesconf.org/


Dear all,

We are delighted to announce the Caleidoscope Research School in
Computational Complexity, to take place at the Institut Henri Poincar??,
Paris 17-21 June 2019. The school is aimed at graduate students and
researchers who already work in some aspects of computational complexity
and/or who would like to learn about the various approaches.


DESCRIPTION

Computational complexity theory was born more than 50 years ago when
researchers started asking themselves what could be computed
efficiently. Classifying problems/functions with respect to the amount
of resources (e.g. time and/or space) needed to solve/compute them
turned out to be an extremely difficult question.  This has led
researchers to develop a remarkable variety of approaches, employing
different mathematical methods and theories.

The future development of complexity theory will require a subtle
understanding of the similarities, differences and limitations of the
many current approaches. In fact, even though these study the same
phenomenon, they are developed today within disjoint communities, with
little or no communication between them (algorithms, logic, programming
theory, algebra...). This dispersion is unfortunate since it hinders the
development of hybrid methods and more generally the advancement of
computational complexity as a whole.

The goal (and peculiarity) of the Caleidoscope school is to reunite in a
single event as many different takes on computational complexity as can
reasonably be fit in one week.  It is intended for graduate students as
well as established researchers who wish to learn more about
neighbouring areas.


LECTURES

1. Boolean circuits and lower bounds. (Rahul Santhanam, University of
Oxford)
2. Algebraic circuits and geometric complexity. (Peter B??rgisser,
Technical University Berlin)
3. Proof complexity and bounded arithmetic. (Sam Buss, University of
California San Diego)
4. Machine-free complexity (descriptive and implicit complexity). (Anuj
Dawar, University of Cambridge and Ugo Dal Lago, University of Bologna)

In addition to these broad-ranging themes, there will also be three more
focussed topics, providing examples of (already established or
potential) interactions between logic, algebra and complexity:

5. Constraint satisfaction problems. (Libor Barto, Charles University in
Prague)
6. Communication complexity. (Sophie Laplante, Paris 7 University)
7. Duality in formal languages and logic. (Daniela Petrisan, Paris 7
University)


REGISTRATION

Registration to the school is free but mandatory. This is to help us
plan tea/coffee breaks and social activities.
