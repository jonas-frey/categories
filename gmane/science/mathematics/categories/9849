Dear friends and colleagues,

Registration is now open for the Summer School on Higher Topos Theory and
Univalent Foundations, which will take place at the University of Leeds
(UK) from Monday 24th June to Friday 28th June, 2019.

The deadline for registration is May 24th, 2019. To register, please follow
the instructions at

https://conferences.leeds.ac.uk/httuf/registration/

Note that you will need to create an account at the University of Leeds
online store in order to register.

The goal of the school is to help PhD students and young researchers to
obtain entry points into the areas of Higher Topos Theory and Univalent
Foundations and, perhaps most importantly, learn about connections between
them. This would help future developments in both subjects, e.g. in the
development of elementary higher topos theory.

The school will consist of the following activities.

Mini-courses:
- Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine (Stockholm University), Univalent Foundations
- Charles Rezk (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Higher Topos
Theory

Invited lectures:
- Benedikt Ahrens (University of Birmingham)
- Andr=C3=A9 Joyal (Universit=C3=A9 du Qu=C3=A9bec =C3=A0 Montr=C3=A9al)
- Emily Riehl (Johns Hopkins University)

Tutorials:
- Nicola Gambino (University of Leeds)
- Paige North (Ohio State University)
- Nima Rasekh (Max Planck Institute for Mathematics)
- Karol Szumilo (University of Leeds)

The website of the summer school can be found at:

https://conferences.leeds.ac.uk/httuf/

If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact the local
organizers at httuf@leeds.ac.uk.

With best regards,
The organisers (Nicola Gambino, Nima Rasekh, Karol Szumilo)
