Dear George You ask

would any categorically
thinking

mathematician say that the
category of pointed sets needs further description as the category of  sets=
  and partial maps?

=20

In 1969-1970=2C recalling

a) the preorigins of sheaf
theory a hundred years ago in the still-non-trivial problem of extending
of partial maps in analysis and topology=2C and

b) desirous of an instrument for describing
sheafication in finitely algebraic terms

=20

Myles and I proposed Ytilda->Omega as one of
the two axioms for an elementary theory of toposes (the other being the Pi
right adjoint to pullback=3B applying Grothendieck=92s method of relativiza=
tion
using any given model U of those axioms=2C the 2-category of U-Toposes was
obtained thus capturing precisely the original SGA4 notion by choice of U).=
  Of
course these axioms were soon shown to be deducible from special cases=2C

but the importance of classifying partial maps
X..->Y remains.

=20

The fact that this construction reduces to
Y+1->1+1 in sets misled some recursion theorists to try to represent partia=
l
recursive maps that way=2C but

the categorically thinking mathematician noted
that in their category=2C the complement of the domain is typically not a
subobject of X. As Phil Mulry showed with his Recursive Topos=2C subobjects=
  of
Omega provide a precise specification of degrees of complication for the
inclusion of the domain of definition by pulling back along X->Omega.
(Although it would seen that Hilbert schemes as subobjects of Omega might
provide similar representability=2C that apparently has not been pursued).

=20

In the Boolean case Y+1 can be viewed as an action of the
two-element monoid of

idempotents (the instrument for analysis of  objects in in a protomodular c=
ategory)=2C
in other words the category of partial maps can be embedded in a topos.Over=
  a general topos=2C that can be replaced by actions of
Omega as a multiplicative monoid .

=20

  Of course
partial maps are special binary relations=2C but of a qualitatively special=
  kind
that requires its own status. In Cat=2C if replace subobjects by discrete
opfibrations=2C the analogous =93partial maps=94  (=94machines=94) turn out=
  to be representable but give rise
analogously to special distributors.

=20

Peter Freyd=92s dictum has a dialectical companion. Category theory
can sometimes discern the germ of nontrivial in the trivial.
