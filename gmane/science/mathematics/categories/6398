A slightly different way of formulating this answer is in terms of
indexed categories / fibrations.  The standard definition of "locally
small indexed category" is, for a "naively Set-indexed category,"
precisely the stronger definition referring to all families (or sets)
of objects.

ategory' itself is equivalent to 'internal category =A0C3=3D>C2->C1 x C1 in=
  the category of classes ', then your notion seems to be a case of the cond=

what =A0would result if we alternatively considered that a category C itsel=
