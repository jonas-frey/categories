"why working mathematicians don't care for foundations?"

very simple anwer:

foundations is just an area within mathematics

the working mathemeticians who care about foundations are those who work
in foundations

why do not ask the question:

"why working mathematicians don't care for ring theory?"

well, because we think that those who work in ring theory are working
mathematicians

but there are a lot who do not work in ring theory, and do not care
either

for foundations it is the same thing

why we give foundations a different status ?
