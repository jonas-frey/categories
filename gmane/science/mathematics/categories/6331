Dear George=2C
Thank you for your comments and questions. =A0I will have to look closely i=
nto the conditions of coverings in your sense to make sure that the off-my-=
hat assertion that unramified maps are an example is indeed correct.=A0Also=
=2C your remark about the path-lifting property being "categorically forced=
" upon you in your work with Aurelio is particularly interesting to me as y=
ou suggested. I will most certainly look into those two points.=A0
I am also familiar with the T-categories and lax algebras=2C so that the wo=
rk of Clementino=2C Hoffman and yourself should be easy for me to understan=
d. =A0I point out (in case you do not know this) that my paper "Coherent ex=
tensions and relational algebras"=2C Trans. AMS 197 (1974) 355-390 introduc=
es lax adjointness=2C =A0examines examples including the T-categories of Bu=
rroni=2C and gives a new analysis of the example of topological spaces in t=
his new light. =A0I mentioned this paper to Maria Manuel Clementino the fir=
st time I heard her talk about this subject=2C as it was obviously relevant=
.=A0
However=2C in view of my imminent trip to Buenos Aires=2C where I will spen=
d most of November=2C I doubt that I will find the time this week to look i=
nto all of that before I return.=A0
With best regards=2CMarta
