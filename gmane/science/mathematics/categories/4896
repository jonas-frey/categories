American patent laws are radically different and more backwards in common
sense than ones say in India. In India you can patent only a process/means
how to do certain thing, not a thing itself, what is more natural, and this
is a main dispute between american industry and various movements in India.

For example, once there is a nuclear energy, one can use it for any thing
which requires energy.
But in american law it is theoretically possible that in times when there
was not  a single nuclear submarine, one registers a patent
for the idea/concept nuclear submarine without
any specific techincal details on construction. Similarly for the concept of
a shoe which charges battery by using the energy disssipated in changing
pressure on the shoe when walking.
In Indian patent law, any specific way to achieve that is patentable.
But somebody else who wishes to independently makes another design
achieving the same function can not be prevented by that patent.

Also in Indian patent law one can not patent existing
natural resources, like species of wild plants, naturally
existing compounds in plants na rocks and alike; and my
understanding is that this hence applies to mathematical facts like number
13 is prime even if before unknown to the mankind.
