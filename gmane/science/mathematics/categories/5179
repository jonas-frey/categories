Steve Lack has just been awarded the Australian Mathematical Society
Medal for 2009:

Australian Mathematical Society Medal recognises distinguished
mathematical sciences research by members of the Australian
Mathematical Society. Eligibility for the medal include the
requirements that the Society member must be under the age of 40
years, and that a significant portion of the research was carried out
in Australia. The Medal was first presented in 1981. It is awarded at
