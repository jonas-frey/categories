The turnstile |- can be viewed as the hom functor (which in a poset is
a truth value), while the horizontal bar is a (di)natural
transformation.  A double bar is a natural isomorphism.  An empty
"numerator" is the constant bifunctor T:C^op x C -> Set that picks out
the one-element set.

So, for example, we have

------ (id)
X |- X

which is a dinatural transformation from T to (X, X); the
corresponding commuting hexagon says that the identity is a left and a
right unit.

Y |- Z     X |- Y
----------------- (cut)
     X |- Z

is a transformation that's natural in X, Z and dinatural in Y.  The
commuting hexagon says that composition is associative.

Currying is usually written as two rules, one for introduction of -o
(linear implication =3D internal hom) and one for eliminating it.  But
it's equivalent to use this natural isomorphism:

X, Y |- Z
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D (curry)
X |- Y -o Z

which is an adjunction.
