Dear  all,

Although I'm not a very "religious" person, I respect all religions, =20
and I also deeply respect, of course, Category Theory. I hope someone =20=

will answer the following question:

Is Category Theory a religion?

As far as I know, it is the only part of mathematics (or of many =20
other sciences) where words such as "dogma", "doctrine" (let alone =20
hyper ones) are used. Recently a few other words with the same =20
religious connotation have been added.
The most frequent one being "evil"

Maybe my english isn't so "beautiful", but in all cases where "evil" =20
has been used, what is wrong with "wrong" instead?
