CALL FOR PAPERS

16th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2019)

June 10-14, 2019 Chapman University, Orange, California, USA

https://qpl2019.org <https://qpl2019.org/> <https://qpl2019.org/ =

* * *

The 16th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic
(QPL 2019) will take place at Chapman University June 10-14, 2019.

The conference brings together researchers working on mathematical
foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and related areas,
with a focus on structural perspectives and the use of logical tools,
ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages,
semantical methods, and other computer science techniques applied to
the study of physical behaviour in general. Work that applies
structures and methods inspired by quantum theory to other fields
(including computer science) is also welcome.

IMPORTANT DATES

   April  1: abstract submission
   April  7: paper submission
   April 30: application for student support
   May   12: notification of authors
   May   17: early registration deadline
   May   24: final papers ready
   June 10-14: conference

INVITED SPEAKERS

   John Baez (UC Riverside)
   Anna Pappa (University College London)
   Joel Wallman (University of Waterloo)

INVITED TUTORIALS

   Ana Belen Sainz (Perimeter Institute)
   Quanlong Wang (University of Oxford)

SUBMISSIONS

Prospective speakers are invited to submit one (or more) of the =
following:

- Original contributions consist of a 5-12 page extended abstract
   that provides sufficient evidence of results of genuine interest
   and enough detail to allow the program committee to assess the
   merits of the work. Submission of substantial albeit partial
   results of work in progress is encouraged.

- Extended abstracts describing work submitted/published elsewhere
   will also be considered, provided the work is recent and relevant
   to the conference. These consist of a 3 page description and should
   include a link to a separate published paper or preprint.

The conference proceedings will be published in Electronic
Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) after the
conference. Only "original contributions" are eligible to be
published in the proceedings.

Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX, and must be submitted in
PDF format. Use of the EPTCS style is encouraged. Submission is done
via EasyChair:

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dqpl2019 =

<https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dqpl2019 =
<https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dqpl2019>>

There will be an award for the best student paper at the discretion
of the programme committee. Papers eligible for the award are those
where all the authors are students at the time of submission.
