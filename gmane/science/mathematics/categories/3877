We remind you that

The 86th edition of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic will =20=

be held at the  Institut =C9lie Cartan (IECN) on the  Universit=E9 Henri =
=20
Poincar=E9  campus in Nancy, France, on the weekend of September 8-9 =
2007.

http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/psslHomeEN.html

The preliminary schedule is now available at

http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/schedule.html


In the PSSL tradition, people arriving not too late Friday are =20
welcome at  Le Petit Cuny,  97 Grande Rue, where some of us will hang =20=

around starting at 7pm, to have drinks and sample the hearty local =20
(well, Alsatian) cuisine, in particular Flammekuche, our very own =20
answer to pizza. There will also be a banquet on Saturday evening for =20=

which those who want to attend will be asked a moderate sum.

Getting to the IECN

Take the tramway in the "CHU Brabois" direction and get off at the =20
"Callot" stop. If you are not directly next to it, you should find =20
Jacques Callot street behind the McDonald's. It leads to the entrance =20=

of the campus. There are two glass-and-steel structures in a similar =20
style, and the IECN is the one that will be to your right (the other, =20=

to your left, is the Loria , the computer science lab). Notice that =20
the entrance to the IECN itself is on the side of the building, =20
inside a small glass-enclosed lobby.

Details to keep in mind

     * The IECN, where PSSL will be held, is normally closed on =20
Saturdays. The head of the IECN has allowed the doors to be =20
automatically unlocked for the following periods: 8-10 and 12-14 on =20
Saturday, and 8-10 on Sunday. If you want to enter the premises =20
outside these hours, please make sure someone is inside to open the =20
door for you.
     * Saturday lunch will be on the premises. You will be given more =20=

information on the Saturday banquet Saturday.
     * You are reminded that there is only one tram every 20 minutes =20
on Sundays. Please look up the schedule before you hit the road =20
Sunday morning.
