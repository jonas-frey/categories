         CALL FOR TUTORIAL, PANEL, AND DISCUSSION PROPOSALS
                             ICFP 2020
  25th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming


                        August 23 - 28, 2020
                               Virtual
                     https://icfp20.sigplan.org/

The 25th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
will be held virtually on August 23-28, 2020.
ICFP provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about the
latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of
functional programming.

Proposals are invited for tutorials, lasting approximately 3 hours each,
to be presented during ICFP and its co-located workshops and other
events. These tutorials are the successor to the CUFP tutorials from
previous years, but we also welcome tutorials whose primary audience is
researchers rather than practitioners. Tutorials may focus either on a
concrete technology or on a theoretical or mathematical tool. Ideally,
tutorials will have a concrete result, such as "Learn to do X with Y"
rather than "Learn language Y".

This year, following the success of the #ShutDownPL event, we are also
inviting proposals for panels and discussions on topics of broader interest
to the PL community.

Tutorials, panels, and discussions may occur before or after ICFP,
co-located with the associated workshops, on August 23 or August 27-28.
