Dear Steve,

Thank you for your prompt  answer.=20

Let me first clarify a possible ambiguity.=20
The Street fibrations I was referring to are defined in his paper:=20
Fibrations in bicategories.  Cahiers Top. Geom. Diff. 21 (1980)
When the bicategory is Cat, they do not coincide with the usual =
fibrations. In particular every equivalence is a Street fibration.

There might be another ambiguity about what you call the Chevalley =
criterium. Could you please tell me with precision what it is (I assume =
p: B -> A is a map in a 2-category C with comma objects and 2-pullbacks)

I shall come back to mathematical questions as soon as these two =
ambiguities are solved.

Best wishes,

Jean

then proves (Proposition 9) that this is equivalent to what Street =

equivalent to that then I have made a mistake somewhere.=20
