Dear Tim,

Your mail begins with:

> Let me put this in a context for non-UK readers of this list.

I think I qualify on both counts, I am a non-UK reader, and still on
this list.
But then you continue with:

> Various=20 bodies in the UK are asking for `impact' as part of
> their assessment of=20
> research.  This is in particular true of the REF exercise.

I'm afraid I don't know what is=20 research and REF exercise. It
seems very important since you say:

> (Perhaps=20 someone else can comment on this as well as I am `out
> of this', having=20 been a victim of a previous round of such
> `exercises'.)

This importance is attested by:

> We all know that=20 mathematics is central to modern technological
> developments,

And=20 occurs in  your mail more than 20 times.

Could you, or any one on the list, please explain briefly to a french
mathematician what=20 mathematics, pure and applied, and REF
exercises are?

Many thanks, and best regards,

Jean
