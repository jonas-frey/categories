CRM 2007/2008: Homotopy Theory and Higher Categories

This is to announce that a research programme on homotopy theory
and higher categories, in a broad sense, will take place at
the CRM in Barcelona during the academic year 2007-2008.
The scientific organisers are Carles Casacuberta (Barcelona),
Andre Joyal (Montreal), Joachim Kock (Barcelona), Amnon Neeman
(Canberra), and Frank Neumann (Leicester).

In addition to a weekly seminar throughout the year, the following
events are scheduled:

- November 5 to 14, 2007: Workshop on Derived Categories
- February 4 to 14, 2008: Advanced Course on Simplicial Methods
in Higher Categories
- February 18 to 22, 2008: Workshop on Algebra and Geometry of Groups
and Classifying Spaces
- April 1 to 5, 2008: Workshop on Topological and Differentiable Stacks
- June 16 to 20, 2008: Workshop on Categorical Groups
- June 30 to July 5, 2008: HOCAT 2008, a conference on Homotopy Structures
in Geometry and Algebra; Derived Categories, Higher Categories

Participants are welcome to any of these activities. Longer-term visits
are partially constrained by office space availability at the CRM.

Please contact the coordinators of each activity or the
CRM Secretariat if you need more information. Updated details
about activities and visitors can be found on the website
http://www.crm.cat/HOCAT/.

With best regards,
The Scientific Organisers
