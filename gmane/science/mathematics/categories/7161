MFPS XXVIII
http://www.math.tulane.edu/~mfps/MFPS28

         Twenty-eighth Conference on the
           Mathematical Foundations of
              Programming Semantics

               University of Bath
                 United Kingdom
                 6 - 9 June 2012

The Twenty-eighth Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics will take place on the campus of the
University of Bath, United Kingdom from June 6 through June 9, 2012.
MFPS conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic,
and computer science that are related to models of computation, in
general, and to the semantics of programming languages, in
particular. The series has particularly stressed providing a forum
where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and
exchange ideas about problems of common interest. As the series also
strives to maintain breadth in its scope, the conference strongly
encourages participation by researchers in neighbouring areas.

TOPICS include, but are not limited to, the following: biocomputation;
concurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed systems; process
calculi; probabilistic systems; constructive mathematics; domain
theory and categorical models; formal languages; formal methods; game
semantics; lambda calculus; programming-language theory; quantum
computation; security; topological models; logic; type systems; type
theory. We also welcome contributions that address applications of
semantics to novel areas such as complex systems, markets, and
networks, for example.

INVITED SPEAKERS:

Steve Awodey, CMU
Michael Clarkson, GWU
Patricia Johann, Strathclyde
Dexter Kozen, Cornell
Drew Moshier, Chapman
John Power, Bath

SPECIAL SESSIONS: There will be four special sessions at the meeting,=20
   each associated with one of the plenary talks:

* Logic, computation and algebraic topology,=20
   organised by Steve Awodey and Michael Mislove

   The papers in this session will be chosen from the papers=20
   submitted in response to this Call.

* Computational effects, organised by John Power

* Computability on Continuous Data, organised by Drew Moshier
    This session is in association with the Alan Turing Centenary

The topic and speakers are yet to be determined
