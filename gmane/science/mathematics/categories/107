The proof I gave is not quite ideal - I showed that if the objects 1-4 yo=
u
list all exist, then they are isomorphic. In theory, it would still be
possible for object 3, say, not to exist. I think the following is a
better proof:

Let X be an object with morphisms 0 : 1 ----> X, s,t : X ----> X such tha=
t
ts=3Dt. We want to construct the map N^2 ----> X. We have a map
f : N ----> X, given by considering X with just 0 and t. For every n in N=
,
we can also form a map g_n : N ----> X by g_n(0)=3Dt^n(0), and g_n(succ)=3D=
s.
Now we can form the map h : N^2 ----> X by h(a,b)=3Dg_a(b). I think this
must be the unique map preserving everything necessary.

Your suggestion of relaxing the condition to ts <=3D t seems to require
changing from ordinary objects to partially-ordered objects. I think the
initial one should be just the free monoid on two generators, with some
partial order. You probably want to insist that s and t be inflationary.
If you=B4re considering partially-ordered objects, then this won=B4t be
isomorphic to N^2. I=B4m not sure whether there will be any isomorphism i=
n
the topos, even without requiring it to preserve order. You could
alternatively consider a condition like t=3Dsts. I=B4m not really sure wh=
at
you mean by your claim that t is the ordinal w - I think the object you
describe isn=B4t even totally ordered - how can you compare t^2(s(0)) and
t^2(0)? If you take a condition like t=3Dsts to make it totally ordered, =
you
still have a decreasing chain t > ts > ts^2 > ...

It looks like this should be something like the interval in N x Z,
lexicographically ordered, going from (0,0) (so without the pairs (0,-n))=
.
If this is still an attempt to construct the reals, then I don=B4t see an=
y
sensible way to describe addition on an infinite lexicographic product of
copies of Z (the integers).

On the matter of it being disconcerting finding infinite sups, the
definition doesn=B4t mention any form of partial order, so it shouldn=B4t
really be any more surprising than finding (Kuratowski) finite sups.

Sorry this email is mostly just intuition, rather than firm fact.
Hopefully some wiser people than I will be able to put more substance to
it.
