Writing V for the category of complete join-semilattices that

=2E

it might be worth pointing out that Uwe's category Rel is a V-category
(in exactly the sense that Eilenberg, Kelly, Street, Day, and others mean=
)
for exactly this choice of V.

With that in mind, the parallel

in additive categories with zero object, finitary (co-)products are
biproducts
  and
in V-categories with zero object, arbitrary (co-)products are biproducts

(first noticed, in my awareness, by Dana May Latch, in the 20th century, =

for the category V of complete join-semilattices itself), is remarkable.

Anyway, the second line of that parallel works much as it does for Rel.

And the "matrix algebra" for maps to products, from coproducts, and, most=

especially, from coproducts to products, works just as it does in the cas=
e
of additive categories, when it comes to these V-categories.

Cheers, -- Fred
