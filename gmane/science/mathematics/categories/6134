Certainly it depends on how the axioms are phrased.  And I only said I
would not be surprised!  When I wrote that, I had the idea that in
Tohoku he phrased AB5 for all filtered colimits of objects, but I see
it is in fact phrased for colimits of subobjects of the given one --
which is pretty obvious now that I see it.

I suppose the issue for constructivizing the proof then comes from AB3
on arbitrary sums together  AB4-5 on their properties.   It would
depend sensitively on how "arbitrary sums" are defined.
