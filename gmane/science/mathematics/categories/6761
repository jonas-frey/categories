Even in a category of sets, I don't see why choice is necessary in
order to complete a small subcategory under finite limits and obtain a
small subcategory.  It seems to me that what is needed is rather the
axiom of collection, which implies that we can find some *set* of
objects containing *at least one* limit for every finite diagram in
the original small subcategory; and then we can iterate countably many
times to obtain a small category which contains at least one limit for
any finite diagram therein.  There is of course no canonical result,
and the various results obtained will not necessarily be strongly
equivalent, but it seems to me that they should all be weakly
equivalent.

And it also seems to me that the same approach should work internal to
any topos.  Collection is true internally to any topos (essentially by
the internal definition of "indexed family"), so it should still be
possible to enlarge a small internal site of definition to one that
has finite limits.  Unless there is some other subtlety that I'm not
seeing.
