(Apologies for cross-listing again, but there are recently added talks
that may be of interest
for those planning to attend the Joint Meetings.)

This message serves two purposes:
Second Announcement of an AMS Homotopy Session at the Joint Meetings
Jan. 6th & 7th, and First Announcement of a Satellite Conference the
afternoon of Jan. 5th at MIT.

Satellite Conference
Thursday, Jan. 5th, tentatively 2:30 to 5:50 PM at MIT, Room 2-105
(building 2, first floor)

AMS Special Session on Homotopy Theory,
Jan. 6th & 7th, 2012 at the Joint Meetings in Boston.

Friday, Jan. 6th, 8-10:50 AM  (no afternoon session)
Saturday, Jan. 7th, 8-10:50 AM and 1-5:50 PM

(The previously announced Special Session on Calculus of Functors and
Its Applications runs for both halves of the day on Friday, Jan. 6th.)

In addition to the session talks, we plan to organize an informal
dinner Friday evening and those attending either session are invited
to join us.  Further details will be posted on our session website
